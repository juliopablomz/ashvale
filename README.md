# Ashvale

**Ashvale** is a Minecraft server project in the *Hack-and-Slash* style, heavily
inspired by games like *Vampire Survivors* and the now-dead (may it rest in peace)
*Dauntless*. It’s an ambitious idea: we’re reimplementing the Minecraft protocol
from scratch in **C** instead of using the usual Java-based tools. There’s no grand reason behind it — we’re doing it for fun and to learn. **That’s it.**

## What the Server Should Look Like

So, you spawn into a **desolate world** (hence the name *Ashvale* — clever, right?). The map is **huge**, monsters are **everywhere**, and they don’t come in peace. They spawn in large numbers, and occasionally, random events shake things up — think **special enemy waves with better drops**, **surprise hordes**, and other chaotic fun.

### Your Goal

Hunt down and defeat the **world bosses** that occasionally show up on the map. To stand a chance, you’ll need to **farm XP and gear** by grinding through weaker mobs.

### The Catch

If you die, you **lose everything** — except what’s safely stored in your **personal chest**, conveniently located in the center of the map (a tiny stronghold, village, or whatever we end up calling it).

**Risk, reward, and a lot of screaming.**

## License

TBD. Probably something permissive. Or cursed. Depends on our mood.
